# Data Analysis with Python

Using python, two datasets were imported into python and analyzed using iterations and calculations. The results of the analyses of each dataset were exported to separate text files. 

## Description
### PyBank:
The financial records of a company were given for analysis in a csv file called 'budget_data.csv.' The dataset was comprised of two columns: 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses.' The goal of the project was to iterate through the financial records and find the following information:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The data were analyzed and the results were stored in a text file.
