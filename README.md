# Data Analysis with Python

Two datasets (PyBank and PyPoll) were imported and simple calculations were performed using a python script.

## Description
### PyBank:
The financial records of a company were given for analysis in a csv file called 'budget_data.csv.' The dataset was comprised of two columns: 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses.' The goal of the project and find the following information using python:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The results were stored in a text file called 'results-PyBank.txt'

### PyPoll:
For this project, a small, rural town needed help modernizing its voting process. A dataset was given containing every vote in a recent election. The dataset was composed of three columns that correspond to a separate vote: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate." The goals of this project were to find the following:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
